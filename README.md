# network54-scrapy
The old network54 forum is failing, there is no longer any support. Critical features are no longer working and there are runmours of data/forums disappearing.

This is a "web scrapper" written in Python and the popular scrapping framework "Scrapy". It can scrape your forum and return the data in JSON, which can then be imported to a new forum.

Search the code base and replace any occurance of `TODO_MY_FORUM_ID` with the ID of your forum.
Good luck.
